# RollTheDiceGame
This is a console game in which you turn the dice, you drop any number from 1 to 6, and then it spells out how many times you have tried to make 6. If you wish, you can add a second player, if one is added after he has made 6, spells out who the winner is (determined depending on the attempts to make 6).
